## Credits

 The excellent staff at UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Bootcamp provided the basic file structure with db & public folders as well as a package.json file. Also provided was a db.json file (inside db folder) to serve as the data base location. The entire front end html, css and javascript were provided in the public folder. The fsUtils.js file in helpers is taken directly from UC coding camp unitl 11 on express; specifically from activity 22, solved file. I also borrowed heavily from the unit 11 activities at the UC Berkeley code camp, in order to implement the code & make the back end function. Finally, I copied open source badges from Vedant Chainani at the website https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk#contents
